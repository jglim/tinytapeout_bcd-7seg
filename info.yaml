# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.

  title:        "BCD to 7-Segment Decoder"
  description:  "Converts a BCD input into a 7-segment display output"
  how_it_works: "The IC accepts four binary-coded decimal input signals, and generates a corresponding 7-segment output signal"
  how_to_test:  "Connect the segment outputs to a 7-segment display. Configure the input (IN0:0, IN1:2, IN2:4, IN3:8). The input value will be shown on the 7-segment display"
  external_hw:  "None"
